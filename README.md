📘 Fake Job Posting Analysis (EDA using Python)
🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of job postings to identify patterns that can help detect fake or fraudulent job advertisements.
The main goal is to explore the data, find missing values, visualize trends, and understand how fake job postings differ from real ones.

🧩 Key Objectives

Load and understand the dataset structure

Identify missing values and visualize them

Analyze the proportion of real vs. fake job postings

Explore most common job titles, companies, and locations

Compare job description length for real and fake jobs

Generate meaningful insights through visualizations

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Steps Involved

Importing Libraries:
Used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for analysis and visualization.

Loading Dataset:
Loaded the dataset fake_job_postings.csv using pandas.

Data Cleaning:
Checked shape, columns, data types, and handled missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized missing data

Compared real vs. fake jobs

Analyzed top job titles, companies, and locations

Examined description length patterns

Insights & Observations:

Fake job postings often have incomplete details.

Real job postings usually have detailed company profiles and job descriptions.

Most fake jobs show repetitive or unclear descriptions.

🧾 Conclusion

This analysis helps in understanding how fake job postings differ from real ones.
It highlights the importance of data cleaning, visualization, and pattern recognition before applying any machine learning model.
